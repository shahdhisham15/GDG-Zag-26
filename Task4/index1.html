        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <pre>Hello! iam a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in front-end techniques. My journey into web development began a three years ago when i discoverd the power of creating beautiful , functional websites that can reach millions of users worldwide.
            I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly interfaces using <b style="color: blue;">HTML</b>,<b style="color: blue;">CSS</b> and <b style="color: blue;">JavaScript</b>. My approach to development focuses on clean code , accessibility , performance optimization.
            When I first started learning web development, HTML was my entry point—it felt like discovering the skeleton of the web. I remember the excitement of creating my first simple page with just a few tags, realizing I could build something from nothing. Then came CSS,
            which was like adding color and life to that skeleton.
            I spent hours experimenting with backgrounds, fonts, and layouts, amazed at how small tweaks could completely change the look of a page.
            But everything truly came alive when I learned JavaScript. It was like giving my webpages a brain—suddenly buttons clicked, animations moved, and my projects reacted to users. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript wasnt just about code;
            it felt like watching my creativity take shape one layer at a time.
